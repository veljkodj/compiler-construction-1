Project developed for course "Compiler Construction 1" (2020)

## About
Compiler for MicroJava language which is used in the practical part of the compiler construction course. MicroJava is similar to Java, but simpler. Check out PDF file "Programski jezik MikroJava" to learn more about MicroJava language. 

Compiler performs lexical, syntax and semantic analysis and then generates code that can be executed on MicroJava virtual machine. Check out PDF files "pp1_2019_2020_jan" and "pp1_2019_2020_jul" for all project requirements.

JFlex is used for generating lexical analyzer and CUP is used for generating LALR parser. 

Designed and implemented as standalone application in Java.

Individual project implemented as a part of the "Compiler Construction 1" course (30%).
